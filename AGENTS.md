# Copilot Instructions for Gitoxide

This repository contains `gitoxide` - a pure Rust implementation of Git. This document provides guidance for GitHub Copilot when working with this codebase.

## Project Overview

- **Language**: Rust (MSRV documented in gix/Cargo.toml)
- **Structure**: Cargo workspace with multiple crates (gix-\*, gitoxide-core, etc.)
- **Main crates**: `gix` (library entrypoint), `gitoxide` binary (CLI tools: `gix` and `ein`)
- **Purpose**: Provide a high-performance, safe Git implementation with both library and CLI interfaces

## Development Practices

### AI Agent Communication

- AI agents communicating through a person's account must identify themselves, for example in issue or PR descriptions and comments.
- AI assistance that does not replace the person as the speaker, such as proofreading or wording polish, does not require identification.
- Attributing AI assistance in commit metadata, for example with an `Assisted-by:` or `Co-authored-by:` trailer, is welcome but not required.

### Test-First Development

- Protect against regression and make implementing features easy
- Keep it practical - the Rust compiler handles mundane things
- Use git itself as reference implementation; run same tests against git where feasible
- Never use `.unwrap()` in production code, avoid it in tests in favor of `.expect()` or `?`. Use `gix_testtools::Result` most of the time.
- Use `.expect("why")` with context explaining why expectations should hold, but only if it's relevant to the test.

### Error Handling

- Handle all errors, never `unwrap()`
- Provide error chains making it easy to understand what went wrong
- Binaries may use `anyhow::Error` exhaustively (user-facing errors)

#### `gix-error` (preferred for plumbing crates)

Plumbing crates are migrating from `thiserror` enums to `gix-error`. Check whether a crate already
uses `gix-error` (look at its `Cargo.toml`); if it does, follow the patterns below. If it still uses
`thiserror`, keep using `thiserror` for consistency within that crate.

- **Error type alias**: `pub type Error = gix_error::Exn<gix_error::Message>;`
- **Static messages**: `gix_error::message("something failed")`
- **Formatted messages**: `gix_error::message!("failed to read {path}")`
- **Wrapping callee errors with context**: `.or_raise(|| message("context about what failed"))?`
- **Standalone error (no callee)**: `Err(message("something went wrong").raise())`
- **Wrapping an `impl Error` with context**: `err.and_raise(message("context"))`
- **Closure/callback bounds**: use `Result<T, Exn>` (bare), not `Exn<Message>`;
  inside the function, convert with `.or_raise(|| message("..."))?`;
  inside the closure, convert typed to bare with `.or_erased()`
- **`Exn<E>` does NOT implement `std::error::Error`** — this is by design.
  - To convert: use `.into_error()` to get `gix_error::Error` (which does implement `std::error::Error`)
  - Example: `std::io::Error::other(exn.into_error())`
- **In tests** returning `gix_testtools::Result` (= `Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>`), `Exn` can't be used
  with `?` directly — use `.map_err(|e| e.into_error())?`
- **Common imports**: `use gix_error::{message, ErrorExt, ResultExt};`
- See `gix-error/src/lib.rs` module docs for a full migration guide from `thiserror`

### Commit Messages

Follow "purposeful conventional commits" style:

- Use conventional commit prefixes ONLY if message should appear in changelog
- Breaking changes MUST use `!` before the colon: `change!:`, `remove!:`, `rename!:`, or _scoped_ forms like `feat(gix-odb)!:`
- Features/fixes visible to users: `feat:`, `fix:`
- For a changelog-worthy commit touching multiple crates, _scope_ it to the crate that should receive the changelog entry, like `feat!(gix-ref)`.
- Refactors/chores: no prefix (don't affect users)
- Examples:
  - `feat: add Repository::foo() to do great things. (#234)`
  - `fix: don't panic when calling foo() in a bare repository. (#456)`
  - `change!: rename Foo to Bar. (#123)`
  - `feat(gix-odb)!: add a new object lookup API`
  - `fix(gix-ref)!: reject invalid reference names`

### Code Style

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- When creating directory-backed Rust modules, use the `mod.rs` style (`foo/mod.rs`) rather than a sibling `foo.rs` file.
- No `.unwrap()` - use `.expect("context")` if you are sure this can't fail.
- Prefer references in plumbing crates to avoid expensive clones
- Avoid calling `.detach()` unless an owned value is explicitly required. Many `gix` APIs accept attached ids and references directly, so prefer keeping repository-backed handles like `gix::Id` when possible.
- Name variables holding untyped Git object IDs `<type>_id` or `*_<type>_id` (for example, `commit_id`, `root_tree_id`, or `note_blob_id`) so the object kind is always explicit.
- Use `gix_features::threading::*` for interior mutability primitives

### Path Handling

- Paths are byte-oriented in git (even on Windows via MSYS2 abstraction)
- Use `gix::path::*` utilities to convert git paths (`BString`) to `OsStr`/`Path` or use custom types

## Building and Testing

### Quick Commands

- `just test` - Run all tests, clippy, journey tests, and try building docs
- `just check` - Build all code in suitable configurations
- `just clippy` - Run clippy on all crates
- `cargo test` - Run unit tests only

### Build Variants

- `cargo build --release` - Default build (big but pretty, ~2.5min)
- `cargo build --release --no-default-features --features lean` - Lean build (~1.5min)
- `cargo build --release --no-default-features --features small` - Minimal deps (~46s)

### Test Best Practices

- Run tests before making changes to understand existing issues
- Use `GIX_TEST_IGNORE_ARCHIVES=1` when testing on macOS/Windows
- Journey tests validate CLI behavior end-to-end
- Fixture scripts should document what behavior they exercise and what makes
  the fixture special. Leave clear-text breadcrumbs so future readers can tell
  which details are essential to the test. Use markdown doc-strings when available.
- Stabilize fixtures whose generated contents can vary by using the
  `_needs_archive` variants of functions in `gix-testtools`; these always use
  packaged archived fixtures instead of platform-local generated output.
- Use assertion descriptions to state what is being asserted. For `assert*!`
  macros this is the last parameter; for `insta::assert*` macros it is the
  second parameter. Prefer messages that explain the invariant, not just that an
  assertion failed.

## Architecture Decisions

### Plumbing vs Porcelain

- **Plumbing crates**: Low-level, take references, expose mutable parts as arguments
- **Porcelain (gix)**: High-level, convenient, may clone Repository for user convenience
- Platforms: cheap to create, keep reference to Repository
- Caches: more expensive, clone `Repository` or free of lifetimes

### Options vs Context

- Use `Options` for branching behavior configuration (can be defaulted)
- Use `Context` for data required for operation (cannot be defaulted)

## Crate Organization

### Common Crates

- `gix`: Main library entrypoint (porcelain)
- `gix-object`, `gix-ref`, `gix-config`: Core git data structures
- `gix-odb`, `gix-pack`: Object database and pack handling
- `gix-diff`, `gix-merge`, `gix-status`: Operations
- `gitoxide-core`: Shared CLI functionality

## Documentation

- High-level docs: README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, DEVELOPMENT.md
- Crate status: crate-status.md
- Stability guide: STABILITY.md
- Always update docs if directly related to code changes

## CI and Releases

- Ubuntu-latest git version is the compatibility target
- `cargo smart-release` for releases (driven by commit messages)
- Every commit must be self-contained and pass CI independently
   - Feel free to run `etc/scripts/ci-check-local.sh --thorough` until it passes as proxy, as running every commit against CI isn't feasible.
- Keep breaking changes and all adaptations required to build and test the workspace in the same commit
- When such a commit touches multiple crates, _scope_ its conventional commit message to the crate whose changelog should receive the entry

## When Suggesting Changes

1. Understand the plumbing vs porcelain distinction
2. Check existing patterns in similar crates
3. Follow error handling conventions strictly
4. Ensure changes work with feature flags (small, lean, max, max-pure)
5. Consider impact on both library and CLI users
6. Test against real git repositories when possible
