//! ## About `debug_assert!()
//!
//! The idea is to have code that won't panic in production. Thus, if in production that assertion would fail,
//! we will rather let the code run and hope it will either be correct enough or fail in more graceful ways later.
//!
//! Once such a case becomes a bug and is reproduced in testing, the debug-assertion will kick in and hopefully
//! contribute to finding a fix faster.
