/// Perform a merge between `our_tree` and `their_tree`, using `base_tree` as merge-base.
/// Note that `base_tree` can be an empty tree to indicate 'no common ancestor between the two sides'.
///
/// * `labels` names the ancestor, ours, and theirs resources passed to blob merge drivers and written into text
///   conflict markers.
/// * `objects` loads the input and descendant trees as well as blobs needed for rename detection and content merges.
///   It also backs the returned tree editor for its entire lifetime.
/// * `write_blob_to_odb` persists content produced by a blob merge and returns the object ID to place in the result
///   tree. Existing input blobs are reused without calling it.
/// * `diff_state` is reusable scratch space for both ancestor-to-side tree diffs and blob-content merges.
/// * `diff_resource_cache` loads and caches blob resources used to determine rename similarity when [`options.rewrites`](Options::rewrites)
///   enables rewrite tracking.
/// * `blob_merge` is a pre-configured platform used when both sides changed compatible non-tree entries. It must not
///   fall back to worktree data: all merge inputs come from the supplied trees and `objects` database.
/// * [`options`](Options) configures rewrite tracking, blob and symlink conflict handling, merge-driver context, conflict-marker
///   size, forced tree-conflict resolution, and whether to stop at the first selected kind of unresolved conflict.
///
/// ### Side handling
///
/// The scheduler swaps the sides to share resolution logic instead of generally privileging one input.
/// If either side has ambiguous rewrite identities, it also chooses a canonical starting side so reversing ours and
/// theirs does not change how those rewrites are paired. Exact merge symmetry is still not guaranteed because
/// conflict-marker content and forced "ours" resolution are directional by definition.
///
/// ### Algorithm
///
/// 1. Diff the ancestor against each side, including rename detection, to obtain two flat lists of tracked changes.
/// 2. Build a path tree for each list. Its nodes point back to list entries and make same-path, tree/non-tree,
///    and renamed-directory interactions discoverable.
/// 3. Start an editor at the ancestor tree and process pending changes from one list against the other list's path tree.
///    A change can be applied directly, paired with another change and merged, consumed only as part of a conflict, or
///    transformed into a deferred change at a rewritten or unique path.
/// 4. Append deferred changes as pending work, then swap the two side-lists and repeat until neither side has pending
///    changes. Swapping roles lets the same scheduling and resolution code process both inputs.
///
/// Each tracked change therefore records both whether it still needs processing and whether its effect is actually
/// represented in the editor. This is why "processed without application" is distinct from "applied": a forced
/// ancestor resolution may consume a deletion while retaining the ancestor entry, and later path conflicts must not
/// behave as if that deletion had removed it.
///
/// ### Relation to Git's `merge-ort`
///
/// Git's `merge-ort` is the behavioral reference, but it uses different state and result construction. It collects all
/// relevant files and directories from the three input trees in a full-path map, detects and processes renames, then
/// resolves entries in reverse path order. As each directory is completed, it writes that subtree to the object database
/// and ultimately returns a parsed result tree.
///
/// This implementation instead diffs the ancestor against each side into flat change lists with path indexes, schedules
/// interactions between those lists, and applies resolved changes to an ancestor-backed sparse tree editor. It writes
/// newly merged blobs through `write_blob_to_odb`, but leaves serialization of the returned editor to the caller.
///
/// If `gix-diff` reports a copy, it is normalized to an addition because the source remains in place. By comparison,
/// `merge-ort` configures its diffcore pass for rename detection, not copy detection.
///
/// Both produce an as-merged-as-possible tree and retain conflict information. Here a conflict records either an
/// automatic [`Resolution`] or a [`ResolutionFailure`]; [`TreatAsUnresolved`](crate::tree::TreatAsUnresolved) determines
/// which recorded resolutions a caller still considers unresolved, so unresolved conflicts are not limited to content
/// containing conflict markers.
///
/// ### Performance
///
/// Note that `objects` *should* have an object cache to greatly accelerate tree-retrieval.
