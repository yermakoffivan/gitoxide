//! Change discovery and structural matching for tree merges.
//!
//! This module turns each base-to-side tree diff into a [`SideState`]: a flat
//! [`ChangeList`] containing scheduling state, paired with a [`TreeNodes`] path
//! index whose entries point back into that list. It also finds path and rename
//! interactions between sides and classifies the pairs consumed by the resolver.
//!
//! Semantic conflict resolution and edits to the result tree belong to the
//! sibling `resolve` module; this module only prepares, indexes, and matches work.
